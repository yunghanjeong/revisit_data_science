# Revisiting Data Science

This repository was created to review high level data science concepts and tasks during my job search. In addition to the review, this repository serves as a high level tutorial for anyone wanting to learn more about data science on their own or use as their personal review material. Series of blogs were written on [Medium](https://medium.com) as a supplementary tutorial. 

## Overview

## Data
The original dataset was provided by the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en.html) from their [Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). The dataset included in this repository was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles) marked with Open Database License. This dataset was merged, cleaned, and uploaded by [Debajyoti Podder](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder). 

Please note that 'CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv' was renamed to 'Emissions_Canada.csv' for ease of use.
