# Revisiting Data Science
This repository was created to review high level data science concepts and tasks during my job search. In addition to the review, this repository serves as a high level tutorial for anyone wanting to learn more about data science on their own or use as their personal review material. Series of blogs were written on [Medium](https://medium.com) as a supplementary tutorial. 

## Overview
This repository/project is separated into 3 parts: EDA, Linear Regression, and Classification.

### Explorartory Data Analysis
Exploratory data anaylsis (EDA) will be performed on the downloaded dataset. First, the data will be cleaned and formatted to prepare for modeling in the future. Second, a series of data visualization will be created to convery concise understanding of the dataset. Last, a series of statistical testing will be performed to strategize future modeling process. 

### Linear Regression


### Classification

## Data
The original dataset was provided by the [Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en.html) from their [Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data). The dataset included in this repository was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles) marked with Open Database License. This dataset was merged, cleaned, and uploaded by [Debajyoti Podder](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder). 

Please note that 'CO2 Emissions_Canada.csv' was renamed to 'Emissions_Canada.csv' for ease of use.
